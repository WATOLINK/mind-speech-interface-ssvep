# mind-speech-interface-ssvep
Mind-Speech Interface for NeuroTechX Student Clubs Competition 2022

This repository includes offline data collection and analysis tools for SSVEP, trainable models for SSVEP prediction, as well as an SSVEP text/speech interface.

Platform Support: Currently our repository supports Windows 10 and up, as well as MacOS Big Sur and newer.
Note: For Mac devices with ARM SOCs (M1, M2 etc) you will need to run our tools in a Rosetta emulated terminal.

## Credit
Some of our models and signal processing methods were adapted from Aravind Ravi's Brain Computer Interface Repository (see here: https://github.com/aaravindravi/Brain-computer-interfaces)

## Requirements

To install requirements, make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed, then run
```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure to run the command from the base directory (mind-speech-interface-ssvep) of the Git repo

## General Hardware Setup

Our software tools support the OpenBCI Cyton board as well as the gtec Unicorn Hybrid for EEG data capturing.   

When setting up the device please make sure the channel numbers correspond to the following 10-20 electrode locations.

## Offline SSVEP Data Collection 

To run the offline data-collection demo, copy and paste the following commands:
```python
    cd mind-speech-interface-ssvep/ODC-DEMO
```
ODC-DEMO/configs.py --> open this file in a text editor and ensure the NUM_STIMS value is set to your desired # of stimuli (4 or 6 or 8)

for openBCI 
```python
    python run_demo.py --board-id=0 --serial-port=deviceserialport
```
for gTec
```python
    python ODC-DEMO/4_stim_demo.py --board-id=8 
```
Note: to find your device serial port, either look in you device settings (windows) or if using a mac type this in the terminal:

    ls /dev/cu.*


## Offline SSVEP Data Analysis 
To visualize the csv created from data collection, in your terminal run:
```python
    jupyter notebook
```
Then in the browser window navigate to the notebook under EEG-Data-Visualization:

Insert the csv name of the recording you want to visualize in this section:

Then click:

And averaged FFT plots of every stimuli response for each electrode will appear at the bottom and look like this:

## Model Training

Training models is relatively simple using the training script! 

The only default parameters to pass would be:

- data: The path to your data. The data path can be a folder of folders of csvs or a path to the csv itself. Both should be fine.
- output-path: The directory where a model will be saved.
- output-name: The name of the saved model.
- model-type: Specify the type of model to train here.

There are some handy flags:
- train: Whether to train a model
- verbose: Whether to output metrics information like accuracy and a confusion matrix to the terminal.

To train a CCA-KNN model, navigate to `mind-speech-interface-ssvep/` and run

```python
python -m eeg_ai_layer.models.train --data=<YOUR_DATA_PATH> --train --output-path=<YOUR_MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH> --output-name=<YOUR_MODEL_NAME>
```

If you'd like to see some metrics, pass the `--verbose` flag like so:

```python
python -m eeg_ai_layer.models.train --data=<YOUR_DATA_PATH> --train --output-path=<YOUR_MODEL_OUTPUT_PATH> --output-name=<YOUR_MODEL_NAME> --verbose
```

## Online SSVEP Interface
To run our fully integrated SSVEP interface, copy and paste the following commands:

```python
    cd mind-speech-interface-ssvep
```
for synthetic board:
```python
    python EEG-DATA-Pipeline/Data_Streamer.py --board-id=-1 --model-path=eeg-ai-layer\modelname.model
```
for non synthetic board:
```python
    python EEG-DATA-Pipeline/Data_Streamer.py --model-path=eeg-ai-layer\modelname.model
```

After following this readme you should be all set to use our repository to communicate with your brain ;)
