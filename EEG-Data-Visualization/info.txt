This folder contains tools used to visualize EEG data (collected offline) and assess EEG Data quality

To use the Notebook in this folder you must clone this repository: https://github.com/aaravindravi/Brain-computer-interfaces

Then you must paste the Notebook found in EEG-Data-Visualization into the Brain Computer Interfaces repository folder 
along with any EEG data (csv files) that you wish to visualize and assess.

Finally, run the notebook to obtain the averaged FFT plots of each stimuli response from the electrode channel of your choice!
